    <h3>Introduction</h3>
    <p>
      I am an aspiring software engineer from the bay area.
      I began my journey at UC Davis studying chemical engineering.
      After graduating and beginning work in Automation for a company
      called Zymergen, I quickly became passionate about software
      engineering. Realizing that my exposure to software development
      is only really about 25% of my job, I have made the decision to
      take the next step in my career and transition into software
      engineering. Completing the coding bootcamp at UC Berkeley is my
      platform to launch into my next career.
    </p>
    <h3>Where I'm From</h3>
    <p>
      My parents both immigrated to the United States from Canada before
      I was born. They planted roots in Roseville, California, a suburb
      of Sacramento. I later moved to Davis for college and soon after
      began to move closer to the bay area as I progressed through jobs
      out of college. I am now currently residing in Oakland, California,
      looking for the next step in my journey.
    </p>
    <h3>What are your favorite hobbies?</h3>
    <p>
      I have a few hobbies that I keep close and committed to. I love
      staying active which includes lifting weights, running, hiking,
      playing a variety of sports (mainly volleyball). I also really
      enjoy reading and try to read at least one book a month. If you
      don't find me doing any of those things, I am probably spending
      time with my friends (probably at brunch over some mimosas).
    </p>
    <h3>What's your dream job?</h3>
    <p>
      Realizing how much I love software engineering has shown me that
      my career aspirations are set on being a technically skilled software
      engineer. The tell tale sign that you love doing something is when
      you find yourself pulling out your laptop to do some coding at 11PM
      just for the fun of it.
    </p>
    <h3>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h3>
    <p>
      If I haven't hammered it home enough by now, I truly love working
      with software and collaborating with colleagues and friends on
      software that can change the world to make it a better place.
      Having power over software comes with a lot of responsibility, and
      my intentions are to use that for the betterment of our global
      society.
