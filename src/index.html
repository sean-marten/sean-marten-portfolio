      <!-- Intro section -->
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>
        I began my journey at UC Davis studying chemical engineering. After
        graduating and beginning work in Automation for a company called
        Zymergen, I found my passion in software engineering. I quickly became
        the software expert on my team and have been the go-to person for
        questions as well as mentoring. The software that I work on is full
        stack application development, mostly with HTML and CSS/Bootstrap for
        our front-end development and JavaScript, C# and Python for our back-end
        development. With almost 2 years of experience in this position, I have
        decided I want to expand my software experience by taking on new
        challenges. In order to round out and sharpen some more of my software
        tools, I decided to begin a certification program through UC Berkeley
        for full stack web development. Along with this, I want to further
        challenge myself by entering a new position where I can take some of my
        application centric skills and apply them to web based software
        engineering, providing a unique skillset and perspective to a future
        employer.

      <h3>Where I'm From</h3>
      <p>
        My parents both immigrated to the United States from Canada before I was
        born. They planted roots in Roseville, California, a suburb of
        Sacramento. I later moved to Davis for college and soon after began to
        move closer to the bay area as I progressed through jobs out of college.
        I am now currently residing in Oakland, California, looking for the next
        step in my journey.

      <!-- Hobby section -->
      <h3>What my favorite hobbies are</h3>
      <p>
        I have a few hobbies that I keep close and committed to. I love staying
        active which includes lifting weights, running, hiking, playing a
        variety of sports (mainly volleyball). I also really enjoy reading and
        try to read at least one book a month. If you don't find me doing any of
        those things, I am probably spending time with my friends (probably at
        brunch over some mimosas).
      </p>
      <!-- End hobby section -->
      <!-- Dream section -->
      <h3>What my dream job is</h3>
      <p>
        Realizing how much I love software engineering has shown me that my
        career aspirations are set on being an extremely skilled software
        engineer. The tell tale sign that you love doing something is when you
        find yourself pulling out your laptop to do some coding at 11PM just for
        the fun of it.
      </p>

      <h3>Where I live</h3>
      <p>
        I currently live in Oakland, California, five minutes from Lake Merritt.
        I have always loved the culture and diversity around the bay area and
        planting roots in Oakland has been just another of the great life
        decisions that I have made thus far.
      </p>
      <!-- End current location section -->
      <!-- Developer section -->
      <h3>Why I want to be a web developer</h3>
      <p>
        If I haven't hammered it home enough by now, I truly love working with
        software and collaborating with colleagues and friends on software that
        can change the world to make it a better place. Having power over
        software comes with a lot of responsibility, and my intentions are to
        use that for the betterment of our global society.
