# Responsive Portfolio
This repository contains my professional portfolio. In it you will find a page detailing my biographical summary, a page about my portfolio specific to web development and a page to get in touch with me.

## Outline of Portfolio
This portfolio has many great features, which are outlined below:
1. Three separate web pages containing my biography, portfolio and a contact form, with a navbar that has links to each of these pages.
2. A responsive layout that utilizes vertical margins on screen sizes larger than the extra small category, and no vertical margins on anything falling in the extra small category.
